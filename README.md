# Project: Logs Analyses

This repo is part of a series of projects belonging to my [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). Purpose of this lesson is to dig deeper into the [flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/), oAuth flows as well as API design and implementation.  

## Installation

The project uses [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as development environment. For more info on setup look into the [VM configuration](/Vagrantfile). To get the VM up and running you need to have both tools (vortualbox and vagrant) installed on your computer. 

1.  `git clone git@github.com:tderleth/1-logs-analysis.git`
2.  `cd 2-item-catalog`
3.  `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`

## Development

In order to start/view the application you need to run the following steps:

1.  `cd /vagrant && python catalog.py`
2.  Go to your browser and view [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
